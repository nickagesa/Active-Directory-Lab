## Overview

This project demonstrates a realistic Active Directory (AD) environment with integrated log monitoring and threat detection capabilities using Splunk and Atomic Red Team to simulate and monitor security incidents.


### Objectives

-   Install virtual box and set up machines.
-   Set up a fully functional Active Directory environment that mimics a real-world enterprise setup.
-   Implement centralized log monitoring using Sysmon and  Splunk Enterprise.
-   To simulate MITRE attacks using Atomic Red Team and Brute force attacks using Crowbar, detect the attacks using splunk.
-   To gain hands-on experience in system administration, security monitoring, and incident detection..
